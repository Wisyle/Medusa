## 🎯 Dual Trading Modes

Decter 001 features an intelligent dual-mode trading system that automatically adapts to market conditions and trading performance.

### 🎪 Continuous Mode (Default)

**Purpose**: Normal trading with profit preservation and risk management

**Key Features**:
- **Consecutive Win Tracking**: Monitors winning streaks for risk adjustment
- **Automatic Risk Reduction**: Reduces stake after 10 consecutive wins
- **Daily Profit Targets**: Sets random 3-5% daily profit goals
- **Auto-Stop Protection**: Stops trading at target + 2% buffer

📊 RECOVERY FORECAST:
└ Loss to Recover: 1.50 XRP
└ Estimated Trades: 4-12
└ Recovery Probability: 82.3%
└ Required Win Rate: 65.0%
└ Time Estimate: 1h 45m
└ Risk Level: MEDIUM RISK

🎲 RECOVERY PARAMETERS:
└ Stake: 1.80 XRP (3.6% - HIGH RISK)
└ Take Profit: 55%
└ Growth Rate: 1.2%
└ Frequency: MEDIUM
└ Mode: RECOVERY 🚨

🧮 STRATEGY:
Account: MEDIUM (500 XRP)
Best Recovery Index: R_25 (optimal volatility)
High-risk stake: 1.8x multiplier for faster recovery
Recovery probability: 82.3% based on market analysis
Estimated completion: 1h 45m with 65% win rate

⏰ CONFIRM RECOVERY? (Yes/No, auto-confirm in 25s)
```

### Mode Switching Logic

**Continuous → Recovery**:
- Triggered when max drawdown reached
- Automatic analysis and parameter optimization
- Admin confirmation with detailed forecast
- High-risk trading engagement

**Recovery → Continuous**:
- Triggered when net P/L becomes positive
- Automatic risk reduction for profit preservation
- Continuous mode profit targets resume
- Consecutive win tracking resets

### Adaptive Risk Management System

When recovery trades fail, the bot automatically implements a progressive risk reduction system to increase the likelihood of success:

**Failure Response Process**:
1. **Failure Detection**: Bot detects losing recovery trade
2. **Risk Reduction**: Automatically reduces stake by 15% per failure
3. **Progressive Scaling**: Each subsequent failure further reduces risk
4. **Safety Floor**: Minimum 30% of original stake maintained
5. **Continuation**: Bot continues recovery with safer parameters

**Risk Reduction Formula**:
- **1st Failure**: 85% of original stake (15% reduction)
- **2nd Failure**: 72% of original stake (28% reduction)
- **3rd Failure**: 61% of original stake (39% reduction)
- **Maximum Reduction**: 30% of original stake (70% reduction cap)

**Failure Notifications**:
```
🚨 RECOVERY FAILURE #2

❌ Recovery trade failed - adjusting strategy
📉 Risk Reduction Applied: 28.0%
🎯 Next Stake Reduced: 72.0% of original
🔄 Continuing recovery with safer parameters...
```

**Success Completion**:
When recovery succeeds, the bot provides a comprehensive summary:
```
🎉 RECOVERY COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!

✅ Net P/L restored to positive
📊 Recovery Stats:
└ Failed Attempts: 3
└ Final Risk Reduction: 39.0%
└ Recovery Strategy: Adaptive Risk Management

🎯 Switching to CONTINUOUS MODE
🛡️ Risk will be managed for profit preservation
📈 Ready for sustainable trading!
```

### Advanced Recovery Forecasting

The engine performs sophisticated calculations for recovery scenarios:

**Loss Analysis**:
- Exact loss amount to recover
- Current account balance assessment
- Risk tolerance based on account size

**Recovery Calculations**:
- Optimal stake size with safety margins
- Expected profit per trade estimates
- Trade count requirements (min/max scenarios)
- Required win rate for success
- Probability assessment based on volatility

**Risk Assessment Levels**:
- **LOW RISK**: >80% probability, stable markets
- **MEDIUM RISK**: 60-80% probability, moderate volatility
- **HIGH RISK**: 40-60% probability, high volatility
- **VERY HIGH RISK**: <40% probability, extreme conditions

### Volatility-Based Parameter Calculation

#### Account Size Categories
- **Small Accounts** (<500 XRP): 0.8% stake, conservative approach
- **Medium Accounts** (500-2000 XRP): 1.5% stake, balanced approach  
- **Large Accounts** (>2000 XRP): 2.5% stake, aggressive approach

#### Volatility-Based Adjustments
- **High Volatility** (>10%): Lower stake, 30% take-profit, low frequency
- **Medium Volatility** (5-10%): Medium stake, 45% take-profit, medium frequency
- **Low Volatility** (<5%): Higher stake, 50% take-profit, high frequency

#### Recovery Mode Multipliers
- **Risk Multiplier**: 1.8x standard stake for faster recovery
- **Frequency**: Always medium for balanced recovery approach
- **Take-Profit**: Volatility-adjusted with recovery optimization
- **Safety Caps**: Maximum 10% of account balance per trade

### Confirmation System
- **30-Second Countdown**: Admin has 30 seconds to respond
- **5-Second Updates**: Countdown updates every 5 seconds
- **"Yes" Response**: Applies parameters and resumes trading
- **"No" Response**: Keeps bot paused until manual restart
- **Auto-Confirmation**: Automatically applies parameters if no response

### Recovery Results Preservation
Unlike continuous mode, recovery mode results are preserved permanently:
- **Thought Process**: Converted to final recovery summary
- **Forecast Data**: Permanently displayed for reference
- **Strategy Details**: Complete recovery plan documentation
- **No Auto-Deletion**: Results remain visible for analysis

**⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER**: This trading bot involves real money and financial risk. The dual-mode system is designed to optimize performance through intelligent mode switching, but cannot eliminate risk entirely. Recovery mode uses higher stakes and should be understood before use. Always start with small amounts, understand both trading modes thoroughly, and never trade more than you can afford to lose. Past performance does not guarantee future results.

**🎖️ Remember**: Decter 001's dual-mode system adapts to market conditions automatically. Continuous mode preserves profits with automatic risk reduction, while recovery mode provides intelligent high-risk recovery when needed. Both modes work together to maximize long-term profitability. Use responsibly and monitor regularly.
