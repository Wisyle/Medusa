    logger.info(f"=== MAX DRAWDOWN REACHED ===")
    logger.info(f"Cumulative loss: {self.cumulative_loss:.2f} XRP")
    # ... comprehensive triggering with error handling
```

    "trading_mode": current_mode,
    "consecutive_wins": self.consecutive_wins,
    "take_profit": trade.take_profit,
    "growth_rate": trade.growth_rate * 100,
    "currency": trade.currency,
    "cumulative_pl": self.stats["net_pl"],
    "growth_percentage": self.stats["growth"],
    # Recovery-specific fields when applicable
    "recovery_failures": ...,
    "recovery_risk_reduction": ...,
    "recovery_probability": ...,
