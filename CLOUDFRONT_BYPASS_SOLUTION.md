# CloudFront Bypass Solution Guide

## üö® Current Issue
Your application is experiencing **DNS resolution failures** when trying to access `api.bybit.com`. This is different from CloudFront blocking and indicates either:

1. **DNS Blocking**: Your ISP or hosting provider blocks access to Bybit domains
2. **Regional Restrictions**: Geographic restrictions at the DNS level
3. **Network Configuration**: Firewall or routing issues

## üîß Solutions Applied

### 1. Enhanced CloudFront Bypass Methods ‚úÖ
- **Updated IP pools** with fresh Singapore, UAE, Hong Kong, Japan, US, and UK IPs
- **Fixed domain typo** (`api.bytick.com` ‚Üí `api.bybit.com`)
- **Added 11 bypass methods** including:
  - Multiple geographic IP spoofing
  - Testnet fallback endpoints
  - Clean header fallback
  - DNS bypass with proxy support

### 2. Improved Error Detection ‚úÖ
- Enhanced CloudFront blocking detection
- Better error messages with suggestions
- Retry delays to avoid rate limiting

### 3. DNS Resolution Improvements ‚úÖ
- Added alternative DNS server support
- Proxy configuration support via `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variable

## üåê Immediate Solutions

### Option 1: Use Proxy (Recommended)
Set environment variable for proxy:
```bash
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy-server:port
# OR for authenticated proxy:
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://username:password@proxy-server:port
```

### Option 2: VPN Setup
Configure a VPN connection to:
- **Singapore** (recommended for Bybit)
- **UAE/Dubai**
- **Hong Kong**
- **United Kingdom**

### Option 3: Alternative DNS
On your server, configure alternative DNS:
```bash
# Add to /etc/resolv.conf (Linux)
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 1.1.1.1

# Or for Windows, change DNS in network settings to:
# Primary: 8.8.8.8 (Google)
# Secondary: 1.1.1.1 (Cloudflare)
```

### Option 4: Use Different Hosting Provider
Consider hosting providers with better IP reputation:
- **DigitalOcean** (Singapore/London droplets)
- **AWS EC2** (Singapore/Ireland regions)
- **Vultr** (Tokyo/Singapore locations)
- **Linode** (Singapore/London datacenters)

## üöÄ For Render.com Users

### Add Environment Variables
In your Render dashboard, add:
```
HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy-service-url:port
SINGAPORE_IP_POOL=custom-ip-list-here
```

### Alternative: Use Render's Different Regions
Try deploying in different Render regions:
- Oregon (us-west)
- Virginia (us-east)
- Frankfurt (eu-central)
- Singapore (ap-southeast) - if available

## üîÑ Testing Your Connection

Run the test script:
```bash
python test_cloudfront_bypass.py
```

Expected output for working connection:
```
‚úÖ SUCCESS! Server time: 1704657600
```

## üìä Monitoring & Debugging

### Check Current IP Reputation
```bash
# Check your server's public IP
curl ifconfig.me

# Test if IP is blocked
curl -v --connect-timeout 10 https://api.bybit.com/v5/market/time
```

### Log Analysis
Monitor your application logs for:
- `CloudFront bypass failed after X attempts`
- `Geographic restrictions detected`
- DNS resolution errors

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Custom IP Pools
Set custom IP pools via environment variables:
```bash
export SINGAPORE_IP_POOL="1.2.3.4,5.6.7.8,9.10.11.12"
```

### Proxy Authentication
For authenticated proxies:
```bash
export HTTPS_PROXY="http://username:password@proxy.example.com:8080"
```

## üÜò Emergency Fallback

If all methods fail, temporarily use **Bybit Testnet**:
1. Set `sandbox: true` in your configuration
2. Use testnet API keys
3. Monitor for when main API becomes accessible

**üí° Key Takeaway**: The DNS resolution failure suggests your hosting provider's IP range is blocked. A VPN, proxy, or different hosting provider will likely resolve this issue permanently.
